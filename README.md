# Quadrivo - Permisionless Agreement based Credit Delegation and Funding

Welcome to Quadrivo, a cutting-edge platform designed for permissionless credit delegation and project funding. This repository holds the core components of Quadrivo, providing users with a seamless experience in sponsoring, managing delegation agreements, and contributing to innovative projects.

Quadrivo introduces a novel approach to decentralized finance by combining the power of credit delegation and quadratic funding. Sponsors can deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault, receive corresponding shares, and actively participate in the funding ecosystem.

### Key Features

   - New shares or vault tokens are minted and allocated to sponsors.

2. **Register Delegation Agreement**
   - Sponsors define utilization criteria for their funds.
   - Criteria may include NFT ownership, network deployment specifics, or token holdings.

3. **Register Project**
   - During project creation, agreements across all chains are verified.
   - A total matching pool for the project is calculated.
